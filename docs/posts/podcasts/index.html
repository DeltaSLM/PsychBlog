<p>I&rsquo;ve split this into two parts - <em>Ongoing</em> and <em>One-time</em>. I do this as ongoing podcasts seem to generally have a different vibe</p>
<p>oh also, the platforms mentioned are where I listened to them. They are in no way all that theyre on, or what theyre best to listen to</p>
<h1 id="one-time">One-time</h1>
<p>By &ldquo;One-time&rdquo;, I mean podcasts that have a set span, or a few seasons, rather than just an ongoing stream of new episodes</p>
<h2 id="the-missing-crypto-queen">The Missing Crypto-Queen</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>BBC Sounds
A nine-part podcast series about the scam around a fake crypto-currency called OneCoin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From BBC Sounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr Ruja Ignatova persuaded millions to join her financial revolution. Then she disappeared. Why? Jamie Bartlett presents a story of greed, deceit and herd madness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has an investigation around how Dr Ruja disappeared, which was interesting in of itself. But in my opinion far more interesting was their investigation into the currency itself, and the way the scam was so successful. They talk to bitcoin/crypto/blockchain professionals, as well as those who were scammed, and how it effected them. Very interesting!</p>
<h2 id="the-habitat">The Habitat</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Spotify</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A seven-part (+bonuses) series about 6 people locked in a fake mars environment atop a Hawaiian mountain for a year. They volunteer themselves to help NASA scientists understand how living in isolation for years on end will effect humans.</p>
<p>The podcast is a mix of audio recordings from &ldquo;The Habitat&rdquo; and some speculation and investigation by the host. I love the slow progression of the crew members from well-getting-along friends, then as they split off into factions, and inevitably start to find and be overwhelmed by the negatives in each other. Also some good space nerdyness in there, which I always appreciate</p>
<h2 id="the-evening-rocket">The evening rocket</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>BBC Sounds
Continuing with the nerd theme (because i&rsquo;m a massive nerd), the evening rocket is 5-part documentary about Elon Musk&rsquo;s form of Capitalism, and how he created his companies like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From BBC Sounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jill Lepore untangles the strange sci-fi roots of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s extreme capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks into not only Musk, but also his form of Capitalism - Muskism. Obviously, I&rsquo;m always partial to stuff that looks into (mocks) capitalism, but after listning to it for a bit, I started to find all the rest really interesting too. Not only does it look into all the sci-fi roots of it, but it also talks about Musk himself - his childhood and what led him to where he is. It also has a perfect, calming vibe for sleeping to.</p>
<h1 id="ongoing">Ongoing</h1>
<p>Podcasts that aren&rsquo;t a set thing, just carry on.</p>
<h2 id="sleep-with-me">Sleep with me</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Google Podcasts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned, I often use podcasts to help me fall asleep, so I was bound to mention this at some point. This is a hour-and-a-half long podcast that rambles on in a monotonous voice about boring topics.</p>
<h2 id="phoebe-reads-a-mystery">Phoebe Reads a Mystery</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Google Podcasts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another one that I use solely for sleeping, but it&rsquo;s basically just a nice voice reading a nice book. Reccomend the Arsene Lupin one (not from my bias opinion of just finishing Lupin on netflix&hellip; not at all)</p>
<h2 id="linux-action-news">Linux Action News</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Google Podcasts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, LAN. A 20-min roundup of the weeks news in regards to Linux and slightly wider technology in general. Obviously there are dozens of things that provide the same thing, but I like this one. Fight me</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve managed to stay this long, thank you, I appreciate it &lt;3</p>
