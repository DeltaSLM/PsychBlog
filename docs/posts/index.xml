      <description>I embarked on trying to create a public website today, and, evidently, have suceeded. I currently cannot afford another domain, nor hosting for the website, so this is the story of how I made a, fully functional, free website.
Hosting My personal site is currently hosted on my VPS, but it is often a hassle to deal with. I am happy with that, for that site, as I feel it provides a good learning experience, but for this site I just wanted something that would work.</description>

      <description>#+property: header-args:elisp :exports code #+startup: fold Intro One day I was bored, and in bordom i was redditing, and in redditing i saw emacs, and then i wanted emacs, so voilas
I shoud definitely also mention that lots of this is plagerised&amp;hellip; mostly from some random 3000+line config I found on my PC which i have no idea where from
Doom Configuration Modules Doom uses a modular configuration&amp;hellip; thingy that makes emacs easier to config.</description>

      <description>Emacs I recently switched from vim to Emacs! Some observations commense here
Emacs is not a text editor! Well. not just a text editor&amp;hellip; From the website: &amp;ldquo;At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing.&amp;rdquo;
What does this mean? Emacs is purely a lisp interpreter, same as you might find a python intepreter installed on your system.</description>
