I embarked on trying to create a public website today, and, evidently, have suceeded. I currently cannot afford another domain, nor hosting for the website, so this is the story of how I made a, fully hosted functional, free website.

# Hosting
My personal site is currently hosted on my VPS, but it is often a hassle to deal with. I am happy with that, for that site, as I feel it provides a good learning experience, but for this site I just wanted something that would work.
I looked for some way to host a website that was free, but also provided support for custom domains. Thankfully, I only wanted this site to be static, which made it all a lot easier. I settled on [https://pages.github.com](github pages)
